# Receipt Extractor

A sample test project for scanning supermarket or restaurant receipts, extracting structured data (store name, date, total amount, items), and storing results in a database.  
The system uses **Tesseract.js** for OCR, **Cloudinary** for image storage, and **Apollo GraphQL + Prisma** for data management.  
after you successfully run the application, you can upload a receipt image and it will extract the data and store it in the database. for testing purposes, you can use the provided sample receipt image in the `/assets` folder.

## üñ• System Architecture

<!-- The following diagram shows how the components interact: -->

<!-- ![System Architecture](./root_readme_architecture.png) -->

**Flow Overview:**
1. User uploads a receipt image from the Next.js frontend.
2. Apollo GraphQL API receives and validates the image.
3. The validated image is processed by Tesseract.js OCR to extract text.
4. Parsing logic structures the extracted data (store, date, total, items).
5. If parsing is successful, structured data is saved to PostgreSQL via Prisma.
6. The image is then uploaded to Cloudinary for storage.
7. Frontend queries and displays the results.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- **Docker** & **Docker Compose**
- Cloudinary account for storing images
- `.env` files in `/client` and `/server`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikiyas-girma/receipt-extractor.git
cd receipt-extractor
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Create .env files

---

/client/.env with the following variables:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=''
NEXT_NODE_ENV=''
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=''
```

/server/.env with the following variables:
```env
PORT=5000

# Database
POSTGRES_USER=''
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=''
POSTGRES_DB=''

# Prisma
DATABASE_URL=''

# cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_NAME=''
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=''
CLOUDINARY_SECRET=''

```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the application
#### be sure to run this command from the root of the repository folder
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
or in detached mode
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Access the application
- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Apollo Server: [http://localhost:5000/graphql](http://localhost:5000/graphql)



### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Quick Start (Recommended)
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mikiyas-girma/receipt-extractor.git
   cd receipt-extractor
   ```
2. Create the required `.env` files in both the `/client` and `/server` folders (see above for variable examples).
3. Make sure Docker & Docker Compose are installed and running.
4. From the root directory, run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
That's it! The application will build and start both the frontend and backend containers as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
